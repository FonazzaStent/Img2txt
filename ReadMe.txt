Image to Text 1.1.2

The program will convert a photo to text, with the purpose of analyzing it to spot intelligible words. Use the program with photos of clouds, sea, soil, vegetation or any other photo of natural or man-made homogeneous configuration, to reveal the hidden universal-philosophical messages of the image. You can also use it on photos of people or art pieces to have a psychological insight of the person portrayed or the image author. The resulting text will be a long string of mostly repeating characters but, every so often, you will notice an intelligible word, either spelled normally or with repeated letters, missing letters or anagrammed letters.

Instructions:

- Open the program, click on File - Open (or Alt-F or Alt-O)
- Load an image file in BMP, JPG or PNG format

The resulting text will appear in the text window. You can copy it through File-Copy or by rigth clicking on it (or Alt-C). You can save the yext through the Save command of the File menu or Alt-S. File-Quit or Alt-Q to quit the program.
