Image to Text 1.1.0

The program will convert a photo to text, with the purpose of analyzing it to spot intelligible words. Use the program with selfies, profile pics, photos of artworks you created or your friends did, your pet's photo, photos of clouds, sea, soil, vegetation or any other photo, to reveal the hidden messages of the image. If you use it on photo portraits, such as Facebook selfies, it may reveal less visible aspects of the portrayed person's personality. The resulting text will be a long string of mostly repeating characters but, every so often, you will notice an intelligible word, either spelled normally or with repeated letters, missing letters or anagrammed letters. It takes a little allegoric-freudian psychological exegetic ability to elaborate the right chain of mind associations to infere a convincing interpretation of the resulting text. You may want to share the text with a psychologist to get a professional opinion on your interpretation, but sometimes the meaning will be surprisingly obvious.
