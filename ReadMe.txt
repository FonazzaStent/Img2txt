Image to Text 1.1.0

The program will convert an image to text, with the purpose of analyzing it to spot intelligible words. Use the program with selfies, profile pics, photos of artworks you created or your friends did, your pet's photo or any other image, to reveal the hidden messages of the image. If you use it on photo portraits, such as Facebook selfies, it may reveal less visible aspects of the portrayed person's personality. The resulting text will be a long string of mostly repeating characters but, every so often, you'll notice an intelligible word, either spelled normally or with repeated letters, missing letters or anagrammed letters. It takes a little allegoric-freudian psychological exegetic ability to elaborate the right chain of mind associations to infere a convincing interpretation of the resulting text. You may want to share the text with a psychologist to get a professional opinion on your interpretation, but sometimes the meaning will be surprisingly obvious.

Instructions:

- Open the program, click on File - Open (or Alt-F or Alt-O)
- Load an image file in BMP, JPG or PNG format

The resulting text will appear in the text window. The window will display only the first 20.000 characters, which you can copy through File-Copy or by rigth clicking on it (or Alt-C). If you want to read the whole text you must save it, through the Save command in the File menu or Alt-S. Because the program converts the image file through two different algorithms only the first one will be displayed partially in the window and the second one will be contained in the saved text file. File-Quit or Alt-Q to quit the program.
